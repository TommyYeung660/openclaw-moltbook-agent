# Moltbook Quant Analysis Scanner
#
# NOTE: Prefer OpenClaw's built-in cron scheduler instead of system crontab.
# If you *must* run via system cron inside a container, use something like:
#
#   0 * * * * MOLTBOOK_API_KEY=... /workspace/scripts/scan-quant-posts.sh >> /workspace/logs/scan-cron.log 2>&1
#
# But in OpenClaw we will create a cron job that triggers the scan.
